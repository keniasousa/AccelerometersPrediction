The purpose of this project is to predict the manner in which participants did the exercise using accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. 

The project includes the following files:

1. README.md: The present file that explains how the script works and how all the files are connected.

2. AccelerometersPrediction.Rmd: Script that gets the data collected from the accelerometers and predict the manner in which participants did the exercise.

3. AccelerometersPrediction.html: Resulting html page that depicts the source code and the result of its execution.

4. The data containing training data set and testing data set: pml-training.csv and pml-testing.csv.

5. Figure folder containing the figures.

6. Folder containing style files separately so the html is not self contained and it has a smaller size.

In order to run the script in the R markdown file AccelerometersPrediction.Rmd, clone (download) this repository from GitHub in your working directory to be able to view the compiled html file of the analysis. 

Here is the direct link to the repository: https://github.com/keniasousa/AccelerometersPrediction.git

The file of the data set is also available in the links listed as follows:

The training data:

The test data:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

Open the R markdown file AccelerometersPrediction.Rmd in RStudio and click on "Knit HTML".

Use knitr to convert the R markdown file AccelerometersPrediction.Rmd into the AccelerometersPrediction.html page.
