The purpose of this project is to predict the manner in which participants did the exercise using accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. 

The project includes the following files:

1. README.md: The present file that explains how the script works and how all the files are connected.

2. AccelerometersPrediction.Rmd: Script that gets the data collected from the accelerometers and predict the manner in which participants did the exercise.

3. AccelerometersPrediction.html: Resulting html page that depicts the source code and the result of its execution.

4. The data containing training data set and testing data set: pml-training.csv and pml-testing.csv.

In order to run the script in the R markdown file AccelerometersPrediction.Rmd,  save the files listed above in your working directory. The file of the data set is available in the links listed as follows:

The training data: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

Open the R markdown file AccelerometersPrediction.Rmd in RStudio and click on "Knit HTML".

The R markdown file AccelerometersPrediction.Rmd creates the AccelerometersPrediction.html page.
